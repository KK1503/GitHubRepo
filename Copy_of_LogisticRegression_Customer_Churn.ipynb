        "###**Context & Need**\n",
        "Recurring-revenue telcos lose significant ARR to customer churn. Proactive retention (discounts, outreach, plan optimization) works only if we can **identify at-risk customers before they leave** and target them efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Objective**\n",
        "Build a supervised classification model that predicts whether a customer will **churn** (`Churn`: Yes/No) using account, service, and billing attributes (e.g., **tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly/total charges, internet/phone services, addons**). The model’s scores will drive retention actions and offer personalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###**Data**\n",
        "Input features include demographics and service/billing fields (see dataset dictionary in your code). Target is binary **churn** (Yes=1/No=0). ID fields (e.g., `customerID`) carry no signal and are excluded.\n",
